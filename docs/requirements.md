# Ice Cream Menu

## Create a webpage that displays the menu for an ice cream shop.

### Objectives and requirements

To complete the assignment, you must:

1. Create a public repo in your personal Github account.
2. Create HTML, CSS, JS, and markdown files and add them to your project.
3. Push your code to Github.
4. Deploy your application to Heroku.
5. Bootstrap can be used if you wish, but it is not required.

Your code should store the menu data in JavaScript variables and loop through those results to build your menu page.

Your menu should group menu items by type and display them in different sections.

You should apply at least basic styling to your menu page. If time permits and you are so inclined, you can go nuts and make something really schnazzy. :-)

### Data

Your ice cream shop's menu will have 4 types of products: 
1. Regular ice cream flavors 
2. Seasonal ice cream flavors 
3. Toppings 
4. Serving options

Examples of regular ice cream flavors: 1. Chocolate 2. Vanilla 3. Strawberry

Examples of seasonal ice cream flavors: 1. Salted Caramel 2. Pumpkin spice

Examples of toppings: 1. Chocolate sauce 2. Marshmallows 3. Sprinkles

If you're feeling creative, you can make your own data set. If not, you can use projects.js.
